Windows:

Download whisper.cpp from https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp/releases, go to the latest release, open Assets and download the one fitting your system

Linux:
Run the linux build script, choose a suitable backend or default (cpu) if unsure. The CPU backend is the slowest but the most reliable inference backend.

The executable in both cases should be in whisper/whisper.cpp/build/bin/whisper-cli
